# Tribal-Wars-Credits-Extractor
Extracts Tribal Wars by InnoGames credits from the website into Mobygames import format-ish

# How

 - Go to https://www.tribalwars.net/en-uk/page/credits
 - Open your browser's developer tools
 - Paste the following to the console and return

```js
// Dates Suck Start
// https://stackoverflow.com/a/15397495

const nth = (d) => {
  if (d > 3 && d < 21) return 'th';
  switch (d % 10) {
    case 1:  return "st";
    case 2:  return "nd";
    case 3:  return "rd";
    default: return "th";
  }
};

const todaysdate = new Date(+new Date);
const date = todaysdate.getDate();
const month = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"][todaysdate.getMonth()];

today = `${month} ${date}${nth(date)}, ${todaysdate.getFullYear()}`;

// Dates Suck End
// Inject jQuery Start even though might be not necessary

javascript: (function(e, s) {
    e.src = s;
    e.onload = function() {
        jQuery.noConflict();
        console.log('%c jQuery injected', 'color:red');
        gettribalcredits()
    };
    document.head.appendChild(e);
})(document.createElement('script'), '//code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js')

// Inject jQuery End

function gettribalcredits() {

let supergroup = jQuery('h2').text(); // get group of groups

var credits = {};
var credits_text = '';

jQuery('div.bordered-box').each(function (){

	let group = jQuery(this).find('h3').text();
	
    var title_order = [];
	
	jQuery(this).find('tr').each(function() {
		
		let name = jQuery(this).find('td').first().text();
		let title = jQuery(this).find('td').last().text();
		
		if ( !(group in credits) ) {
			credits[group] = {};
		}
		if ( !(title in credits[group]) ) {
			credits[group][title] = [];
			credits[group][title].push(name);
			
			title_order.push(title);
		} else {
			credits[group][title].push(name);
		}
		
	});
	
	credits_text += '\n' + supergroup + ': ' + group + ' (website credits ' + today + ')\n';
	title_order.forEach(function (title, title_index) {
		credits_text += '\n' + title + '\n';
		credits[group][title].forEach(function (name, name_index) {
			credits_text += name + '\n';
		});
	});
	

});

console.log(credits_text);

}
```
 - drag-select the output text and copy it to Notepad++
 - Remember there are two pages (as of writing this), do the same on the other page ( https://www.tribalwars.net/en-uk/page/team )

Now it's time for manual cleanup:

 - split role titles, e.g. "Managing Director / Visionary Creator"
 - ensure proper cAsE in titles, groups, etc.
 - Protip for group (title case) checking: regex-search repeatedly for `\r\n\r\n^.*$\r\n\r\n`‚Äîthough this skips the first one if there's no empty line above.
 - handle silly stuff like 'üç© Arjeta Avllaj ‚òï'
 - Delete the accidental 'join our team' group, obviously
 - Maybe also manually add the copyright info from below the footer
 - take screenshots, see below 

# Screenshot

- Go to https://www.tribalwars.net/en-uk/page/credits
- Avoid using built-in screenshot features and you can do even better than üëçShareXüëç in this situation, otherwise you have to time the ~~stup‚Äì~~ silly scrolling `<marquee>` names, so instead:
- Use browser development tools to double-click-replace `<marquee>` with `<span>` and press return:
- ![demarquee](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2cb6afc0-9a8a-4b8a-889b-9367dfedfda6)
- (optional, expert only) use the devtools to delete elements that just waste Kilobytes like the banner and footer links but best keep stuff that clarifies where we are (top navbar) and the copyright stuff at the bottom.
- Make the browser window narrow-ish (just wide enough for most names to only take up one line) and use [GoFullPage chrome screenshot extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gofullpage-full-page-scre/fdpohaocaechififmbbbbbknoalclacl) or something similar.
- Remember there are two pages (as of writing this), do the same on the other page ( https://www.tribalwars.net/en-uk/page/team )

# Result

The non-cleaned up results look like this:

See how you have to fix case and split "Managing Director / Visionary Creator"?

- I guess "HP Admin" is "Homepage Admin" but WTF is a "Speed Admin"?
- There's plenty to clean up, with "Senior In-Game Supporter" being singular (gotta pluralize) and split among 3 cumulative role titles and all.
- Remember what we agreed on about "Join our team" earlier?

## Screenshots

The clean screenshots look like:

# Post-cleanup matching

Only two changes were added through matching:

![changes](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8822cd9-bb9c-4da9-8cc9-4f9f6770e3e0)

Here compared on text-compare.com

However there was no evidence the identified individuals were correct, so I had to revert those matches.
